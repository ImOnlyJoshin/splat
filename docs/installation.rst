Installation and Dependencies
===============================================

SPLAT is best forked from the github site http://github.org/aburgasser/splat, 
which is updated on a regular basis. Make sure the folder you download the package to is either in your ``PATH`` or ``PYTHON_PATH`` system variable. 

Once you have this in place, You should copy the file ``.splat_access`` into your home directory - this is your access key if you have priveleged access to unpublished data. 

SPLAT has been tested in Python 2.7.X and 3.5.X. It works best in ipython and ipython notebook.

* `astropy <http://www.astropy.org/>`_
